After implementing this, your API calls will work like this:

POST /answer
{
    "query": "Tell me about Zinedine Zidane and how many goals he scored in 1986"
}

Response:
{
    "answer": "RAG processing: Tell me about Zinedine Zidane and how many goals he scored in 1986\n\nTable processing: Tell me about Zinedine Zidane and how many goals he scored in 1986",
    "success": true,
    "error": null
}

The debug output in your console will show:
[DEBUG] Manager Agent processing query: Tell me about Zinedine Zidane and how many goals he scored in 1986
